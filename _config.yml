  I recently graduated with a Master's in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I specialized in Construction Engineering and Management, SRIS, and AI applications. Within the realm of Construction Management, I am higly interested and specialized in <mark>Building Information Modeling (BIM)</mark> and <mark>Virtual Design and Construction (VDC)</mark>, understanding their transformative potential in modern infrastructure projects. My passion lies at the intersection of <mark>deep learning</mark>, <mark>machine learning</mark>, and <mark>data science</mark>. While I have applied these techniques to civil engineering and construction, I am eager to explore their broader applications across various industries and challenges. As a fusion of engineer and data enthusiast, I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to expand my horizons and leverage these computational techniques to their full potential. For a comprehensive, more traditional view of my academic and professional journey, please refer to my [CV](https://uofi.box.com/s/q1jzz2jo1bou04atrciunc2lwbo3wrj0).
  
  Beyond my academic and professional focus, I am actively interested in the advancements of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), fast vehicles and videogames. I have a profound passion for traveling and a deep love for food.
